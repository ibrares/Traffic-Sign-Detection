# Traffic-Sign-Detection

## Project Overview

**Detection and classification of traffic signs in real-time.**  
I used the YOLOv5 large object detection algorithm to achieve accurate and efficient results.

## Dataset

I started with a dataset of 18,000 images spanning 20 different classes.  
After preprocessing, which included data augmentation and other techniques, I expanded the dataset to 55,000 images. This preprocessing step was crucial for improving the model's performance and robustness.
